# TaskManager

## Domain: Tertiary Education (Students not being able to manage their time)
Students are given a number of assignments and tests every week, they are also swamped with work when it is exam time. With that being said one of the main problems that students face is that they don’t know how to manage their time.

## Solution:
So I thought I would tackle this problem by creating a program that would manage all their work that they recive from university.
This program would allow students to manage their time spent on all their various work and be able to complete them on time.

## Input:
Students will input there specific tasks details: 
* The name of the specific task
*	When they are due
*	What individual sub-tasks need to be done in the assignment
*	What sub-tasks have been done on the assignment
* If you have team members and there sub-tasks they will be doing
* What study material you need in order to pass the exam or test

## Output
With all this information the program will be able to:
*	Users will be able to see all their specific tasks on one page and all the information on it with a click of a button.
*	Notify the user on what sub-tasks must still be done
*	Give a reminder on when the specific task is due
*	The specific task will change colours depending on how much tasks must still be complete compared to the due date(if the due date is tomorrow and you have 5 sub-tasks that must be done on a assignment, the assignment will turn red on the program, indicating that it’s urgent)
